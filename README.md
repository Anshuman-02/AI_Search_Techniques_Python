# Implementations of AI Search Techniques: Generate-And-Test and Hill Climbing  

## Overview  
This repository contains Python implementations of two foundational search techniques in Artificial Intelligence:  
1. **Generate-And-Test Algorithm**  
2. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**  

These algorithms are used to explore and solve optimization problems effectively by navigating a search space.

## Features  
- **Generate-And-Test**:  
  - Explores all possible solutions and tests them to find the correct or optimal one.  

- **Hill Climbing**:  
  - Iteratively improves the solution by moving to a better neighboring state until a local optimum is reached.  

---

## Example Scenarios

- **Generate-And-Test**:
  - Finds the correct solution from a set of possibilities, such as solving a puzzle or identifying a valid combination.


- **Hill Climbing**:
  - Solves optimization problems like finding the shortest path, maximizing utility, or other similar scenarios.


## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- No additional libraries are required for basic functionality.
  
## Notes
- The algorithms are implemented in Python for educational purposes.
- Hill Climbing may terminate at a local optimum depending on the problem space.
